# Tic-Tac_Toe
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly.
This project is a simple implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe game from scratch, using functions, handling errors, and processing user input
